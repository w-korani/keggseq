# keggseq:
The package keggseq was developed to apply KEGG enrichment analysis 
    mainly for ployploids utilizing their sub-genomes. 
    keggseq provides some advantages over the available tools
    
It allows applying KEGG enrichment analysis for diploids 
    or ployploids with any levels of gene duplications
    
It generates ready-to-published graphs

It produces graphs of interested pathways that have 
    differentially expressed enzymes marked

It generates csv files containing detailed information of 
    enzymes included in the interested pathways

It allows correcting genes IDs if the user wants to use annotation 
    different from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotation

It is a run-time package since the data is downloaded directly from 
    Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database so 
    it does not require an internal database for specific species

It is step-by-step and easy to be implemented
